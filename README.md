# ✨ Stellar Habits

A visually stunning, high-performance habit tracker designed for those who crave satisfying visual feedback and data-driven progress. Built with **Solid.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, Stellar Habits focuses on a "smart" layout that moves away from traditional calendar grids toward a more intuitive, matrix-based visualization.

## 🌌 The Vision

Stellar Habits is crafted for the OCD/ADHD mind. We believe that tracking habits should be as satisfying as playing a game. Every check-off is designed to feel rewarding, and every view is optimized to reduce cognitive load while providing maximum insight.

### Key Features

- **🛸 Smart Matrix View:** A non-traditional monthly view. Habits as rows, days as columns. See your entire month's consistency at a single glance with glowing, color-coded indicators.
- **📅 Focus Week Mode:** Switch to a detailed weekly view to focus on the "now." Large cards, clear labels, and high-contrast completion states.
- **📊 Visual HUD (Heads-Up Display):** A persistent sidebar featuring real-time radial progress charts, streak counters (Fire), and daily scores (Trophy).
- **✨ Satisfying Micro-interactions:** Fluid animations powered by Motion One. Every interaction feels snappy and deliberate.
- **🛠️ Flexible Management:** Effortlessly add, edit, or remove habits with a dedicated theme-color picker for personalization.
- **💾 Local First:** Your data is yours. Everything is persisted in `localStorage` for instant loading and privacy.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **High Contrast:** Using a Deep Slate/Navy palette (`#0f172a`) ensures that habit colors (Neon/Pastels) pop, making completion states unmistakable.
- **Consistency over Complexity:** The "Smart Matrix" allows you to spot patterns in your behavior (e.g., "I always fail on Tuesdays") without digging through menus.
- **Reduced Friction:** No "Submit" buttons for daily tracking. Click and it's saved.
